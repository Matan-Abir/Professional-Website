                    <p><b>2017-2018</b> : Software Developer at <b><u>Codeo LTD</u></b>. The company built websites and
                        apps for
                        clients on a contractor basis,
                        and during my role there I've worked as fullstack engineer. In one project I worked both
                        front-end and
                        back-end
                        using C#, MSSQL, HTML, CSS, JS while using the MVC framework, and during production was in full
                        contact
                        with clients,
                        dynamically fulfilling emergent needs and adding new features. In another I was primarily an
                        API-developer.

                        <b>Independant Experience</b>: I've worked on several things outside of my "formal work".
                        Several of these
                        projects you can
                        see under the "My Github Repositories" section. <b><u>This website</u></b> is one thing, being
                        coded from
                        the ground-up without
                        a platform such as Wordpress or Wix.<b><u>Others:</u></b> I've also worked on:

                        <li>a discord.js chatbot running in Node.js which performs web-scraping and notifies users who
                            subscribe
                            to it whenever the target website updates</li>
                        <li>demo for a martial arts game I was trying to make. Has a random procedurally-generated
                            world. Github

                    <p><b>2015-2017</b> : I studied software engineering at the National Practical Software Engineering
                        School
                        in the Technion. I graduated with honors, with a grade average of 85.6. The finals project for
                        which you
                        can see in my "The-Underground-Tower" Github Repository. I studied C, ASM, C#, Java, Javascript,
                        SQL as
                        my main languages there, and overall it was my first introduction to programming, which I very
                        much took
                        to. I learned quickly enough that by the start of the second semester I was privately tutoring
                        some of my
                        own classmates, and in my second year the school itself asked me to give remedial lessons to my
                        underclassmen.
